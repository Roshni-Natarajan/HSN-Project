Project Review
=====================================================


Please write detailed comments answering the questions below.
Do not just answer "yes" or "no" - comment on *how well* the authors
address each of these aspects of experimentation, and offer
suggestions for improvement.

## Overview

1) Briefly summarize the experiment in this project.
The author uses this experiment to measure the performance when traffic is switched at the OVS-switch or at the controller.


2) Does the project generally follow the guidelines and parameters we have
learned in class?
The project genereally does follow some of the guidelines and parameters learned in class.



## Experiment design

1) What is the goal of this experiment? Is it a focused, specific goal?
Is it useful and likely to have interesting results?
The goal of the experiment is to measure the difference in performance in terms of delay and throughput when traffic is switched at the OVS-Switch or at the Controller.

2) Are the metric(s) and parameters chosen appropriate for this
experiment goal? Does the experiment design clearly support the experiment goal?
Throughput and Delay were the metrics chosen. The experiment design does support the experiment goal to some extent.

3) Is the experiment well designed to obtain maximum information with the
minimum number of trials?
Yes, the experiment is well designed to obtain maximum information with minimum number of trials.

4) Are the metrics selected for study the *right* metrics? Are they clear,
unambiguous, and likely to lead to correct conclusions? Are there other
metrics that might have been better suited for this experiment?
The metrics selected for study are right metrics. However other metrics too can be used for this experiment, namely measuring convergence.

5) Are the parameters of the experiment meaningful? Are the ranges
over which parameters vary meaningful and representative?
Yes, the parameters of the experiment are meaningful and representative.

6) Have the authors sufficiently addressed the possibility of interactions
between parameters?
The experiment clearly shows how to conduct and perform the experiment, however any possible interaction or such, have not been discussed.


7) Are comparisons made reasonably? Is the baseline selected for comparison appropriate
and realistic?
No visible comparisons were made.


## Communicating results


1) Do the authors report the quantitative results of their experiment?
Only instructions were provided for performing the experiment.

2) Is there information given about the variation and/or distribution of
experimental results?
No such information was provided.

3) Do the authors practice *data integrity* - telling the truth about their data,
avoiding ratio games and other practices to artificially make their results seem better?
No such practices were observed in the data collected. The experimental results seem genuine.

4) Is the data presented in a clear and effective way? If the data is presented in
graphical form, is the type of graph selected appropriate for the "story" that
the data is telling?
The data is represnted clearly in the .txt files, however the author's intentions could not be clearly understood, if no comparison was provided.

5) Are the conclusions drawn by the authors sufficiently supported by the
experiment results?
No conclusions were drawn by the authors.

## Reproducible research



1) Did the authors include instructions for reproducing the experiment in 3 ways (Raw data -> Results,
Existing experiment setup -> Data, and Set up experiment)? Are the instructions clear
and easy to understand?
The instructions provided for performing the experiment is clear and concise. In general, they would be enough to reproduce the experiment.

2) Were you able to successfully produce experiment results?
I couldn't perform the experiment.

3) How long did it take you to run this experiment, from start to finish?


4) Did you need to make any changes or do any additional steps beyond the documentation in order to successfully complete this experiment? Describe *in detail*. How long did these extra steps or changes take to figure out?


5) In the [lecture on reproducible experiments](http://witestlab.poly.edu/~ffund/el6383/files/Reproducible+experiments.pdf), we mentioned six degrees of reproducibility. How would you characterize this experiment - where does it fall on the six degrees of reproducibility?



## Other comments to authors

Please write any other comments that you think might help the authors
of this project improve their experiment.

The experiment was performed well and authors have taken significant effort in this experiment, however the authors intentions are unknown as there is no conclusion or parity for the exepriment as the report only contains the instructions for performing the experiment, without explaining the significance of the results.
